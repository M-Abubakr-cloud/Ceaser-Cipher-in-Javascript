# Ceaser-Cipher-in-Javascript
This GitHub repository provides a simple and effective implementation of the Caesar Cipher Algorithm in JavaScript. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn more about encryption techniques, or an experienced developer looking for a reliable implementation of the algorithm, this repository is a great resource.
## Introduction:

The Caesar Cipher Algorithm is a simple encryption technique that involves shifting each letter of a plaintext message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. In this GitHub repository, you will find an implementation of the Caesar Cipher Algorithm in JavaScript that also includes file handling functionality.

## Features:

In addition to the basic encryption and decryption functions, this implementation of the Caesar Cipher Algorithm in JavaScript also includes file handling functionality. The file handling functionality allows you to encrypt or decrypt the contents of a text file using the Caesar Cipher Algorithm.

To encrypt a file, simply provide the path to the plaintext file and the shift key as input to the encryption function. The function will read the contents of the file, encrypt the message, and write the encrypted message to a new file.

To decrypt a file, provide the path to the encrypted file and the shift key as input to the decryption function. The function will read the contents of the encrypted file, decrypt the message, and write the decrypted message to a new file.

## Conclusion:

This implementation of the Caesar Cipher Algorithm in JavaScript provides a simple and effective way to encrypt and decrypt messages, as well as files. With the file handling functionality, you can easily encrypt or decrypt the contents of a text file, making it a useful tool for data security and privacy.
